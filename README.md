#### FAQs

**Who should attend?**
This event is open to anyone at Andela. It is still open to **remote participation** for employees that can't get to either locations physically.

**I don't have an idea on what to build, should I still attend?**
YES! People are going to pitch ideas on the final week towards the event and you can join any team whose idea you'll like.

**I'm not a developer, should I attend?**
YES! You can still give your contribution through ideation, strategizing, etc.

**Will there be prizes for winners?**
Our internal hackathons are not meant to be a competition but a time of collaboration and fun. We would like to see senior developers collaborating with junior developers; staff with fellows, Nairobi with Lagos, etc. However, top teams will be awarded.
